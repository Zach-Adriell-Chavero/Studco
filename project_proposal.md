## Problem Statement
Students and scholars of all grade levels struggle with one common thing; **studying.** Wherever what journey you take in pisay, you would 
skill have to encounter studying at either one point or another. My project, *"Study Hub For Scholars"*, aims to fix that common issue.

Using notes and folders, users can create easy-to-use notes accessible anytime - anywhere.

## Project Objectives
My project aims to be:
- [ ] Helpful in everyday life
- [ ] Can save some people's education
- [ ] Is informative and provides details
- [ ] Low-ended and fast running
- [ ] Easy to use and user-friendly

## Planned Features
My projects have a lot of planned features.
1. Notes and Folders
    - Notes will be blocks of texts grouped together, covering a topic or subject. Folders contain notes, and organizes them all neatly.
2. Markdown Formatting
    - Notes are planned to use markdown formatting, making them look clean and neat with a whole lot of features.
3. Account Creating
    - Although you can create notes without an account, you require one to view, comment, or edit notes.
4. File Sharing
    - Share individual notes or groups of folders to people, and collaborate to create summarized and formatted notes.
5. Blacklisting
    - Blacklist delinquient users who makes trouble!
  
## Planned Input and Outputs
1. Create a note in markdown, and the result would be a formatted text.
2. Create accounts, and have them render folders and notes shared by other people.

## Flowchart
Here is a flowchart with the planned flow:

This can change at any time, it is only a raw/vague example of the process flow.
